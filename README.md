## Technical Profile
Industrial Data professional with over 7 years of experience specializing in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). I focus on the development of physics-aware machine learning models and automated sensor data pipelines to optimize asset reliability and operational efficiency.

My core expertise lies in bridging the gap between mechanical/thermal engineering systems and advanced statistical modeling to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and equipment failure patterns.

## Strategic Project: NASA Turbofan RUL Optimization (C-MAPSS)
Architected a non-linear degradation model for aircraft turbofans by integrating Unscented Kalman Filters with gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost).

* **Methodology:** Implemented statistical feature selection on 21 sensor channels to isolate high-variance failure indicators.
* **Results:** Achieved a benchmark RMSE of 17.01 and R² of 0.832.
* **Interpretability:** Leveraged SHAP values to decode black-box model predictions into actionable maintenance metrics for field engineers.
